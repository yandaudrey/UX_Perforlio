# Heuristic Evaluation – SpotAngeles 
## Yun-Pu Yang 

### Background
For this project, I would like to conduct heuristic evaluation for an app, [SpotAngels](https://www.spotangels.com/), which designs for users to find parking spots on streets. 

Below are screenshots of SpotAngels––

According to the official website of the app, SpotAngeles can help users "find free parking, get reminders before street cleaning or any other rule, and get deals in garages." This app is a community-based app. Users can upload images of the parking signs and provide updatest parking rules in the app.
