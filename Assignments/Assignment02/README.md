# Usability Testing

### Introduction 
SpotAngeles is an app designed for drivers to find parking spots. On the official website of the app, it states that "SpotAngels is the world's largest community-based parking app, featured by both Apple and Google as “Waze for parking”." 

The heuristic evaluation that I conducted on this app shows that, althought this app plays a useful role to help drivers search parking spots among busy streets, there are some flaws that hunder the performance of this app. This flaws include––
- Recognition rather than recall
- Consistency and standards
- Flexibility and efficiency of use
- Aesthetic and minimalist design

1) Recognition rather than recall
SpotAngeles is a community-based app. It relies on users' sharings about where free and charged parking spots are and what parking limitations apply for certain spots. In order to appeal to users' contributions, the app creates a series of challenges. Once the users complete the challenges, they will earn spotcoins. Concomitely, their avatars will also upgrade. However, the app does not explicitly specify what exact rewards users will receive after earning a large amount of spotcoins and why users should put effort into upgrading their avatars. In order to answer these questions, the users have to refer to [the official website of the app](https://spotangels.notion.site/SpotAngels-FAQ-968c6626cbec41abb5e7025e7f790f25). 

2) Consistency and standards
