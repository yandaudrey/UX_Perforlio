# Usability Testing

### Introduction 
SpotAngels is an app designed for drivers to find parking spots. On the official website of the app, it states that "SpotAngels is the world's largest community-based parking app, featured by both Apple and Google as “Waze for parking”." 

The heuristic evaluation that I conducted on this app shows that, althought this app plays a useful role to help drivers search parking spots among busy streets, there are some flaws that hunder the performance of this app. This flaws include––

- **Recognition rather than recall**

SpotAngels is a community-based app. It relies on users' sharings about where free and charged parking spots are and what parking limitations apply for certain spots. In order to appeal to users' contributions, the app creates a series of challenges. Once the users complete the challenges, they will earn spotcoins. Concomitely, their avatars will also upgrade. However, the app does not explicitly specify what exact rewards users will receive after earning a large amount of spotcoins and why users should put effort into upgrading their avatars. In order to answer these questions, the users have to refer to [the official website of the app](https://spotangels.notion.site/SpotAngels-FAQ-968c6626cbec41abb5e7025e7f790f25). 

- **Consistency and standards**

Although trying to integrate as many business as possible, this app does not update its map very often. Not every business or locations can be found on the app. 

- **Flexibility and efficiency of use**

This app is good for looking for parking spots, but it is short of the feature that calculate the distance between the parking spot and the users' destinations. This causes an inconvinience for users to plan how far they want to park, especially when they are looking for free spots or the cheapest garages. 

- **Aesthetic and minimalist design**

The app is easy to navigate and does not have too many design that will distract users, but it does not look gorgeours. 

### Methodology 
As many people have heard, Los Angels is one of the American cities that has the most chaotic traffic and is difficult to park. For this usability testing, I will assess how useful and user-friendly the app is for Los Angeles users. I have designed three tasks that require my participant to conduct. All of the locations are on Los Angeles. 
- Task 01: I require the participant to search a specific restuarant, find out where they can park, and how far is the parking spot to the retaurant.  
- Task 02: I require the participant to search a specific retail store, find out where the cheapest park spot is, when they can park without receiving a citation, and how much the participant has to pay if only parking for 3 hours. 
- Task 03: I require the participant to search their place, find out where they can park around their home, and where they can park for one week without receiving a citation. 

For the entire testing session, I will record how users fonddle the app and ask the participant to think out loud when they are using the app.

### Reflection
Through this pilot usability testing, I realized that rehearsing alone isn't always enough to guarantee a smooth testing process. Despite preparing in advance and checking my equipment beforehand, some unexpected issues still occurred during the testing. I discovered typos in my questionnaire and overlooked the fact that my phone automatically goes to sleep after 10 minutes of inactivity. Fortunately, I caught this quickly and was able to resume recording, but the interruption caused my video to be split into two parts.

Additionally, I learned that testing an app is a more complex process than testing a website. Usability testing of an app involves recording participants' mouse trackers, facial expressions, and voices, as well as capturing their touch on a mobile phone screen. However, I encountered difficulties with recording participants' touch, as a separate camera would be required to specifically capture their fingers. This is typically available in professional testing labs, but I did not have access to such equipment.
